# :iphone:To Dos App - my own project

  

## :dart: Goal

Create a mobile app where the user can create a list of tasks which is syncronized with mobile calendar.

  

## :clipboard: Options

A user is able to:

 - sign up, login and sign out from the app
 - add a task - with:
	 - title
	 - category
	 - priority
	 - end date
	 - notes
 All above fileds are required except notes which is optional.
 - edit a task
 - mark a task as "finished"
 - delete a task
 - filter tasks by category
 - syncronize the tasks with mobile phone calendar

Every level of priority has own color (from highest it's navy to lowest it's light blue). Additionally the tasks with highest priority are marked with jumping frog (inspired by *Eat that frog*).
When a user delete a task the sound of basket swish is played.
